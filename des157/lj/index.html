                    Those Easily Overlooked Details
                </h3>

                <p class="link">Reading Link: <br><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design by Salim Ansari</a></p>
                <p class="content">The author provides many comparisons between user-friendly forms, and those are not. Today, most people fill in forms online for different reasons, and sometimes it takes some extra steps for the users to understand and adapt to various kinds of formats. As a web designer, I should take care of all the details to make my forms efficient. 
                    <br>
                    <br>Before coding the forms for the websites, I should ask myself a few questions: what kinds of forms will drive me crazy? Which type of form do I like the most? I should also review and test my forms with different people after the coding completes. For example, the author mentions that the label should be outside of the typing boxes because the disappearance may cause inconvenience for those who would need to check again. The author also points out how "trivial" items like placeholder text and fields' size can cause significant confusion. It's common to see, and I know how to handle them right away, but as a designer, it will be crucial to overlook these details.  </p>

                <h3>Sometimes a Designer, but Most of the Time: 
                    <br><b>A User</b></h3>

                <p class="link">Reading Link:<br><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes by Kathryn Whitenton</a></p>
                <p class="content">Even though this article is more from the designers' perspective, I feel a profound resonance as a user. I keep facing the annoying overlays and popping lightboxes almost every day when I try to search for something online. Many shopping websites urgently want to get people's attention as fast as possible so that they can spend money in a second without hesitation. It's funny that we have random advertisements and promotions filling up our mailboxes, and they seem to follow the technology: they turn into digital media as promotional codes. 
                    <br>
                    <br>Recently, a few friends working in the web development industry started to build their blogs. We all got tired of posting pictures and share moments on popular social media platforms. Considering the internet trends today, we frequently feel certain anxiety among the little time and fast pace hiding behind the static or dynamic format to share one's life. It's hard for designers working under restrictions even if they have considered the misusing facts mentioned in the article. 
                    <br>
                    <br>After they opened their blogs and published a few stories, I was amazed at myself quietly reading long paragraphs for almost half an hour. There were no distractions and interruptions because my friends certainly don't want to have any commercial actions from their readers. Their purpose is simple: sharing their daily life. 
                    <br>
                    <br>As the number of mobile users increases, more and more companies start to take care of their website design on smaller screens than desktops. However, it's still easy to see the overuse of overlays everywhere. Sadly, many industries answer the five W questions around their maximum benefits instead of user experience. I hope to see more helpful overlays like introductions or tutorials on the future internet and also my own designs. A good designer should be a user with needs at the same time. Other than the five W questions in the article, it's also essential to ask oneself: what do I feel uneasy? Why? </p>

                <h3>Forget about the words: let's "read" some visual stories</h3>

                <p class="link">Reading Link:<br><a href="https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills by Michael Gonchar</a></p>
                <p class="content">The website I found is an online photograph exhibition by Dennis Berti (<a href="https://dennisberti.com/">Dennis Berti: I'm an honest visual storyteller</a>), a photographer. By clicking the "TAKE THE TOUR" button with attractive animation on the right side of the page, the users enter into his gallery of photos and scan through them one by one. I like this way of having one photo taking up almost the whole space at a time, which reminds me of watching a black and white silent movie. All the photographs have good quality that allows the audience to explore the details carefully, and the artist arranges black and white photos with colorful ones together to make the visual journey not boring at all. The way he puts all the stories in words on another page instead of right next to each photograph can cause some confusion. On the other hand, it also pushes the audience to focus on the pictures themselves and dive into the visual stories in their eyes. </p>

                <h3>Reclaiming Meaning: My Bitter-Sweet Scrapbook</h3>

                <p class="content">I don't like my handwriting and drawing, so I collect all kinds of things and make them into my scrapbook as my journal. The image below is one of the pages I made during my quarter abroad in Florence, Italy. The banners are cut from a perfume store's products pamphlet; the faces on the upper right and bottom left corner are cut from Salvatore Ferragamo museum pamphlet; the middle parts include a Gucci Garden ticket and some pictures from a local public library's event poster. </p>

                <br><br><br><br><br><p class="content">I didn't put this topic on the top of my list because I have stopped making new pages for a while. There are many bitter memories behind this whole book. Even though it has been with me for four years and records many beautiful traveling stories, I still often thought about throwing it away, and I don't know why. When I showed it to my Teacher Assistant Annie in class, she said it was unique and meaningful. Suddenly, I understand the reason for my urger: I can't see the meaning of its companion anymore.</p>
                <p class="content">The whole book is an archive of myself and memories I have in these four years in Davis. As my graduation from this college is coming soon, I want to take this opportunity to conclude this special phase of life. What has passed has become a part of me, and there will be more in the future.
                    <br><br>It's time to say goodby and move on to the next stage.
