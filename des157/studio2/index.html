                <p>I don't like my handwriting and drawing style, so I collect all kinds of things (tickets, table paper, napkins, candy wrappers, etc.) and stick them into my scrapbook as my travel journal. I started this scrapbook since freshman, and now it is too full to close. When my friends come to visit me, I always share my traveling stories with them by looking at what I have collected inside my book. <br><br> Click on different images at the main page and see the story behind them. <br><br>I also have some empty pages in my scrapbook. The emptiness also means something.</p>

                <p>I met with Eon-Joo in  high school in North Carolina. I had never thought I could talk so much with a foreign friend. At the airport, she said, "we should meet each other at least once a year." And then we have never met again. :(</p>

                <p>On July 2nd, 2018, I didn't bring all the documents to the visa officer at the Italian Embassy. I thought I could not start my quarter abroad program, but the officer wrote me what to do in details, explained everything to me extremely patiently, and waited me until I had collected everything. This was the beginning of my unforgettable journey.</p>
