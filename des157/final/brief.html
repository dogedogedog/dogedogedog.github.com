                    <h3>Project Summary</h3>
                    <p>The topic I choose is my identity, and I want to use a long scrolling interface to share several stories so that the audience can have an immersive experience. </p>
                </section>

                <section class="center">
                    <div id="left">
                        <h4>Comparison 1: Lemonade</h4>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="images/lemonade.png" alt="Lemonade">

                        </figure>

                        <p>The website uses simple color contrast and a long animation along with scrolling action. While users continue to scroll through the numbers and read the stories behind them, the red dot draws the line and form different graphics. The overall experience is calm and concentrating because the design makes the trace for users’ eye movement simple, and the font choices put emphasis on the numbers. While the users scroll down, the section before the red dot turns into grey, and the next section’s words come out. Each tag also has a hover effect: the whole button turns into the red color, attracting users to click on it. Although the overall functionality is very advanced, the transition on each section can still be improved. The designers make the numbers start from zero and add up to the final numbers while users scroll through the section, but the point they stop changing is almost when the next section is coming, which can cause confusion.</p>

                    <div id="right">
                        <h4>Comparison 2: This Side of Rice</h4>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="images/rice.png" alt="This Side of Rice">

                        <p>The website shares the designer’s memories behind some Chinese dishes. Since my topic for the final project is my identity and background, her design and content covers the similar ideas and provide a lot of inspirations. The scrolling direction is horizontal, and each section of dishes has a unique table linen with slight patterns and a significant color. Except the beginning and the end of the website, the paragraphs are placed with different angles, making them a part of the dish on the kitchen table. The colors of each major dish are similar but darker than the table linen at the background, which give the sections’ titles some fade-in effect and make a better contrast with the designer’s stories next to each small dish. Initially I was confused while scrolling my fingers from right to left of my touchpad, and nothing moved. Later on I found out that I just needed to use the normal scrolling way: from top to bottom. If I want to use the horizontal direction, I may need to put a short sentence besides my title to instruct my audience to the next step.</p>

                    <h3>Project Goals and Design Strategies</h3>
                    <p>My goal is to have just a few colors to have contrast on my image and content as the strategy of the Lemonade website. I will also use similar strategy to on different font sizes to put visual hierarchy on the titles and key words in my content as what Jenny Zhang has done for her This Side of Rice. </p>

                    <h3>Interaction Strategies and Experience Goals</h3>
                    <p>I plan to have a long scrolling interface so that the reading experience for my audience can be more immersive into my conten. I will also have some hover effects on either the image of each section or the title: when the audience move the mouse over those parts, more content shows up. I want to enhance their reading experience by these ways.</p>
