                <h2>User Test Results</h3>

                <p class="link">Portal Page: <a href="https://dogedogedog.github.io/des157/">https://dogedogedog.github.io/des157/</a></p>
                <p class="content">I tested my page with three students, and they all liked the style and found the concept unique and intriguing. I prepared three tasks for my users:
                    <br><br>1. Trigger the overlay boxes of the years.
                    <br>2. Read to the end of the page.
                    <br>3. Describe what you think the page is about before reading the footer of the page.
                    <br><br>I had a technical issue on my overlays, and the users couldn't complete the first task without my hint, but I also noticed that they clicked on the number because of the over effect. It will be an excellent strategy to lead users' mouse actions. The second task also brought up some problems: two users didn't scroll to the end of the page due to missing instruction to scroll horizontally and less connection among my sections. Instead of completing the third task right away, one student mentioned that she started to browse the page without trying to figure out what the page was about. It leads me to reconsider the purpose of my page. If I only want to share personal stories, her answers would mean that I have achieved my goal. I also want my users to think about what they will write to themselves in the future. Though it depends more on the users' personal feelings, the simple layout indeed helps reduce distractions and focus on the content. 
                    <br>
                    <br>Based on the notes above, I will work on connecting different sections and changing some codes on layout and scrolling parts. </p>
